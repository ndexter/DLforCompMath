    "This notebook demonstrates how to generate images of handwritten digits using [tf.keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/keras) and [eager execution](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/eager) by training a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), for more information see, e.g., the papers [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114), [[2]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.4082).\n",

    "## What is an autoencoder?\n",
    "\n",
    "An autoencoder is a neural network that is trained to attempt to copy its input to its output. Internally, it has a hidden layer $h$ that describes a code used to represent the input. The network may be viewed as consisting of two parts: an encoder function $h = f(x)$ and a decoder that produces a reconstruction $r = g(h)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*oUbsOnYKX5DEpMOK3pH_lg.png\" alt=\"architecture of an autoencoder\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "If an autoencoder succeeds in simply learning to set $g(f(x)) = x$ everywhere, then it is not especially useful. Instead, autoencoders are designed to be unable to learn to copy perfectly. Usually they are restricted in ways that allow them to copy only approximately, and to copy only input that resembles the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way we'll enforce this is by designing a neural network architecture with a bottleneck in the network which forces a **compressed representation** of the original input. If each of the input features were independent of one another, this compression and reconstruction would be a very difficult task. However, if the data possesses some sort of structure (ie. correlations between input features), this structure can be learned and encoded by the layer expressing the bottleneck in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "An autoencoder whose code dimension is less than the input dimension is called undercomplete. Learning an undercomplete representation forces the autoencoder to capture the most salient features of the training data.\n",
    "The learning process is described simply as minimizing a loss function\n",
    "\n",
    "$$L(x, g(f (x)))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $L$ is a loss function penalizing $g(f(x))$ for being dissimilar from $x$, such as the mean squared error.\n",

    "This defines an approximate posterior distribution $q(z|x)$, which takes as input an observation and outputs a set of parameters for the conditional distribution of the latent representation. In this example, we simply model this distribution as a diagonal Gaussian. In this case, the inference network outputs the mean and log-variance parameters of a factorized Gaussian (log-variance instead of the variance directly is for numerical stability).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reparameterization Trick\n",
    "During optimization, we can sample from $q(z|x)$ by first sampling from a unit Gaussian, and then multiplying by the standard deviation and adding the mean. This ensures the gradients could pass through the sample to the inference network parameters.\n",

    "For the inference network, we use two convolutional layers followed by a fully-connected layer. In the generative network, we mirror this architecture by using a fully-connected layer followed by three convolution transpose layers (a.k.a. deconvolutional layers in some contexts). Note, it's common practice to avoid using batch normalization when training VAEs, since the additional stochasticity due to using mini-batches may aggravate instability on top of the stochasticity from sampling."
